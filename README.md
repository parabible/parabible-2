# Parabible 2

Resources to keep track of planning for the next phase of <https://parabible.com>

A large part of the point of this repo was to start the [wiki where I think through the API implementation](https://github.com/parabible/parabible-2/wiki/Parabible-API-(proposal))...

**Note that the proposal no longer fully matches the implementation**

Comments are welcome on the API doc - file issues related to anything (better ideas? great! implementation questions? edge cases I haven't considered...)

## Other repos to keep track of:

- (server v2 [not yet public])
- https://github.com/jcuenod/parabible-client/tree/v2 (a branch of the client that supports the new backend)
- https://github.com/jcuenod/parabible-data-pipeline (build the pg database for the new server, note that this repo does not always track my latest version because it will one day be multiple repos [maybe in their own organization?]. If you have trouble building, let me know)
