# Parabible 2

Resources to keep track of planning for the next phase of <https://parabible.com>

A large part of the point of this repo was to start the [wiki where I think through the API implementation](https://github.com/parabible/parabible-2/wiki/Parabible-API-(proposal))...

Comments are welcome on the API doc - file issues related to anything (better ideas? great! implementation questions? edge cases I haven't considered...)
